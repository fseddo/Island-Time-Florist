## About The Project
<div>
    <p>
    Hey there! We wanted to create an immersive experience that simulates a typical boutique flower shop's website. You can navigate the site as a guest or create a user account to save your cart information. Our front-end is managed with react components and redux stores to minimize while our backend is built in postgreSQL. We have some gatekeeping middleware set up using JWT's to protect our routes and we utilized local storage to get our guest cart working. Enjoy browsing!
